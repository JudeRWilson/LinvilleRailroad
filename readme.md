Map of Linville River Railroad

This map is meant to show the route of the old Linville River Railroad which was once part of the Eastern Tennessee & Western North Carolina Railroad. I am really interested in this part of Appalachia's strange relationship with industrialization, and how the railroad was both very good for appalachia, but used in a explotative way by the rich to take resources from the already poor appalachian people. I am using the index.html file that was given to us as a base, and I modified and added to it as needed to suit my map. I had some issues dealing with centering the map, I had to slightly mess with the map width to get it centered, which worked, but seemed like it was a bit incorrect. My data sources were Google Maps directions converted through the GPX converter. I then added data points (which I couldn't get to show up in my actual map), and converted it into geoJson, which I then converted to be my route.js file. I set that file as my data variable, and then worked on modifying and adding to my index.html file.
